# üöÄ Quick Setup Steps - Sonarr-Seedr Plugin

**Follow these simple steps to get your plugin running on Windows.**

## üîÑ How It Works

This plugin acts as a bridge between Sonarr and Seedr cloud storage. Here's how the folder system works:

- **Torrent Folder**: Sonarr stores `.torrent` files here ‚Üí Plugin watches this folder ‚Üí Uploads to Seedr cloud
- **Watch Folder**: Plugin downloads completed files here ‚Üí Sonarr imports from this folder ‚Üí Organizes your TV shows

**The key**: Both Sonarr and the plugin must use the EXACT SAME folder paths for everything to work automatically. When you drop a torrent file into the Torrent Folder, the entire process happens automatically: Sonarr ‚Üí Plugin ‚Üí Seedr ‚Üí Plugin ‚Üí Sonarr ‚Üí Organized TV show!
